# Bank_Note_Tensorflow
Used Tensorflow to tell whether or not a bank note was authentic. 

# Analysis

The data consists of five columns:
  variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
  skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
  curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
  entropy of image (continuous)
  class (integer)
  
Class indicates whether or not the bank note was actually authentic or not. 

# Libraries

Below were some of the Scikit libraries that I used so that I had the ability to train and test my data. I later used Contrib and TensorFlow to check if the model was able to predict whether or not a bank note was authentic.
